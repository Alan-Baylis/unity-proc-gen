A Sample Project for Procedural Generation with Unity 3D

Here is a related blog post that explains the basics of Procedural Game Development: [Procedural Generation 101](http://johnnycode.com/2016/11/08/procedural-generation-101-for-games/).  I would recommend you check that out first.

In the project, there are 4 scene files and 4 corresponding `LevelDirector` classes (MonoBehaviours).  Try each one out and see the differences!  More or less, each one builds on the last.  Some are only different in their Prefab settings, so be sure to check out the actual GameObject in the scene, or the Prefab itself.

Hope it helps!
